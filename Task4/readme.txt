# 📊 Sentiment Analysis using NLP

## 📁 Project Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on textual data such as reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It demonstrates how to preprocess raw text, convert it into numerical features using TF-IDF, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.
